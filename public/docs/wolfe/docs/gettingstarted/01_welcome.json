It will generally\nbe slow, break unexpectedly, give weird or no warnings etc., so use it at your own risk.\n\n### What is Wolfe\n\nWolfe is a [probabilistic programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home) \nframework aimed at simplifying the process of developing rich machine learning applications. \n\nWolfe acknowledges that at the heart of most machine learning (ML) applications are two concepts:\nmathematical models that assign probabilities or scores to hypotheses (or possible worlds),\nand mathematical operators that interact with these models, most prominently maximization and\nsummation.\n\n### Name\nThe name Wolfe is a reference to [Philip Wolfe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wolfe_\\(mathematician\\)), \na mathematician considered to be one of the founders of [mathematical programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_programming). \nThe name was chosen to reflect Wolfe's grounding in optimization: declaratively defining\nobjective and constraints, and optimizing such mathematical programs, is at the heart\nof Wolfe. Moreover, Wolfe relies on decomposition approaches such as the \n[Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dantzig%E2%80%93Wolfe_decomposition). \n\n### Contributors\nIn alphabetical order:\n* [Jan Noessner](http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/en/people/researchers/jan-noessner/\")\n* [Larysa Visengeriyeva](https://twitter.com/visenger)\n* [Sameer Singh](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~sameer/)\n* [Sebastian Riedel](http://www.riedelcastro.org)\n* [Tim Rockt√§schel](http://rockt.github.io/)\n* [Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com/)\n\n\n",
